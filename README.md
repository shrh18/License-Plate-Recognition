# License-Plate-Recognition
This project implements License Plate Recognition using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm within the OpenCV library. The script processes input images or videos to detect and recognize license plates by loading a pre-trained YOLO model, performing object detection, and applying non-maximum suppression to filter and refine the bounding boxes. It handles different input types, including image files, video files, and webcam feeds, and outputs the processed media with detected license plates marked. The code is configurable via command-line arguments and outputs the results to specified files while displaying the detection in real-time.
